      "\n",
      "RAPID POPULATION GROWTH\n",
      "\n",
      "Bend was the fastest growing city of its size outside of \n",
      "the southern United States in 2016, and sixth overall \n",
      "for cities of more than 50,000. The explosive growth \n",
      "hearkens back to the 1990s, a decade in which Bend \n",
      "more than doubled its population. 1\n",
      "\n",
      "The District is already home to 12,000 more residents \n",
      "than it was in 2012, when the last Comprehensive \n",
      "Plan was updated. Future projections show the District \n",
      "population will exceed 113,000 by 2028 (Figure 1, \n",
      "p. 21). New residents often bring recreation interests \n",
      "and expectations from other locales. This can enhance \n",
      "the variety of activities and amenities the District \n",
      "provides, but new interests can also compete for space \n",
      "with established activities. This Comprehensive Plan \n",
      "addresses growth by calling for more parks, trails, \n",
      "amenities and an indoor recreation facility in the \n",
      "next 10 years. Additionally, the plan is designed to be \n",
      "flexible to meet new and varied demands for park and \n",
      "recreation services. \n",
      "\n",
      "INCREASING COST OF LIVING\n",
      "\n",
      "Rapid population growth has increased the cost of \n",
      "living in Bend, where the cost is 32% higher than \n",
      "the national average. The high cost of housing is a \n",
      "significant factor driving this increase.2 Housing is \n",
      "typically the largest expense in a household budget and \n",
      "with limited remaining resources it can be difficult to \n",
      "enjoy the quality of life that attracts people to Bend. \n",
      "In this situation, the District’s role in providing high \n",
      "quality, low cost opportunities to recreate becomes \n",
      "increasingly important.  \n",
      "\n",
      "PUBLIC HEALTH AND ACTIVE LIVING\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States is facing a public health crisis \n",
      "stemming from decreased physical activity. \n",
      "Communities across the country are experiencing rising \n",
      "levels of obesity and increasing rates of diabetes and \n",
      "\n",
      "heart disease3. This plan aims to provide a park with ½ \n",
      "mile walking distance of most homes in order to ensure \n",
      "that everyone in Bend has access to a place to play \n",
      "and exercise. Additionally, this plan calls for increased \n",
      "collaboration with Deschutes County Public Health \n",
      "to seek creative ways to improve public health through \n",
      "parks and recreation. \n",
      "\n",
      "A HOME AND A TOURIST DESTINATION\n",
      "\n",
      "Bend is a four-season destination. With over five \n",
      "million visitor days a year,4  the local population swells \n",
      "with tourists each day. While these visitors enjoy a \n",
      "variety of different activities in the area, many enjoy at \n",
      "least some of the parks offered by the District. While \n",
      "the park system is primarily built to the scale of the \n",
      "local community, some areas, notably the parks along \n",
      "the Deschutes River, experience significant impacts \n",
      "from tourism. The District has built parks to a high \n",
      "standard, recognizing this intensity of use, but with an \n",
      "increase in the number of tourists visiting each year, \n",
      "parks will continue to regularly serve more people.  This \n",
      "plan aims to ensure that locals continue to experience \n",

      "TRAILS AND ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION\n",

      "past surveys, the 2017 public input through Mapita \n",
      "introduced a new way of thinking about the District’s \n",

      "\n",
      "Over the past 10 years, the methods used to plan for \n",
      "park and recreation services have evolved significantly. \n",
      "In 1983, the National Recreation and Park Association \n",
      "(NRPA) published a book entitled Recreation, Park and \n",
      "Open Space Standards and Guidelines. This publication \n",
      "discussed the amount of park land communities \n",
      "need in terms of mile radiuses, and acres of parks per \n",
      "1,000 people. However, over time, there is increasing \n",
      "recognition that each community has different needs. \n",

      "community needs. \n",
      "\n",
      "To assess the District’s needs, staff and the Board \n",

      "Trust for Public Land (TPL), a national public land \n",
      "\n",
      "advocacy organization. The TPL model advocates for \n",
      "a park within a 10-minute walk of every home, which \n",
      "is considered a ½ mile walking distance. The District \n",
      "used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to measure \n",
      "the walking distance from each home to the entrance \n",
      "of the closest park, based on the walking routes people \n",
      "use. Barriers such as highways or railroad tracks were \n",

      "evenly distributed throughout the District. Residents \n",
      "who received the survey were given the option of \n",
      "returning the survey by mail or completing it online. \n",
      "Ten days after the surveys were mailed, the consultant \n",
      "sent emails and placed phone calls to the households \n",
      "that received the surveys to encourage participation. \n",
      "The goal was to obtain completed surveys from at least \n",
      "400 households, which was exceeded with a total of \n",
      "532 responses. The overall result of the sample of 532 \n",
      "households has a margin of error of at least +/-4.25% at \n",
      "a 95% level of confidence. \n",
      "\n",
      "The survey findings helped inform District staff about \n",
      "the wide range of needs within the District, and how \n",
      "well those needs are being met. This was accomplished \n",
      "by asking the following two questions: \n",
      "\n",
      "“Please indicate if you or any member of your \n",
      "household has a need for or interest in each of the park \n",
      "and recreational facilities listed below.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“If yes, please rate how well your need for each facility \n",

      "Meets Needs,” and 1 means “Does not Meet Needs” of \n",
      "your household.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The District used answers from these two questions \n",
      "to identify the community’s greatest needs (Figure 2, \n",
      "p. 64) and then determine how well those needs are \n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "being met (Figure 3, p. 65). Understanding not only \n",
      "the community’s needs, but how well those needs are \n",
      "being met is an important factor in determining how \n",
      "the District should direct its resources. The District calls \n",
      "this analysis of community needs, and how well those \n",

      "District assigned for the highest, high, moderate and \n",
      "low priorities, based on the level of need identified by \n",
      "the community. The Board of Directors determined \n",
      "that the higher the community need, the more the \n",

      "households expressed need, in which the District will \n",
      "strive to meet at least 80% of that need. High needs are \n",
      "those needs that 25-49% of households expressed need, \n",

    "Code Explanation: \n",
    "\n",
    "The smf.ols() function in Python's statsmodels package is used to perform Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code smf.ols(\"num_visitors ~ park_size + num_facilities + maintenance_budget\", data=parks_data), we are specifying the regression formula. The formula specifies that the dependent variable num_visitors is regressed on the independent variables park_size, num_facilities, and maintenance_budget. The ~ sign in the formula separates the left-hand side (dependent variable) from the right-hand side (independent variables), and the + sign is used to separate the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data parameter is used to specify the dataset to use in the regression analysis. In this case, parks_data is the DataFrame that contains the data on the parks and recs metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fit() method is used to fit the regression model to the data. Once the model has been fit, the resulting object model contains information about the regression coefficients, standard errors, t-statistics, and p-values, among other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the entire code model = smf.ols(\"num_visitors ~ park_size + num_facilities + maintenance_budget\", data=parks_data).fit() is creating a linear regression model where num_visitors is the dependent variable and park_size, num_facilities, and maintenance_budget are the independent variables. It then fits the model to the parks_data dataset and stores the results in the model object."
